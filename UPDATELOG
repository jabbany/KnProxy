-- Initial release (Ver 4.00) --
Knproxy Theta (v4) is out with loads of new improvements!!
=======
1. Slimmer Engine
The method used for fetching and parsing has been greatly slimmed down. Knproxy now runs on half the processing resources!

2. Improved Parsing
New specialized parsing for css/js and html with checks on MIME type to give the best optimized effect.
 The regexes have also been fixed meaning a compatibility for more websites. Tags with href=" href=' and href= are all supported in this version.
 CSS parsing improvements prevent the page suffering from bad css.
 JS scripts are basically ignored to speed up the loading.
 Also, images and other attachments need not go through the parsing engine to prevent breaking (if a good content type is sent).

3. Better Support for POST forms and COOKIEs
Support for POST and COOKIES is now built into the knHTTP request engine. (And needs no special plugin as in v3)
COOKIES can now be stored locally instead of on server and are loaded faster.
GET requests are on the way!

4. Improved Error Checking
Error checks are built in natively. Tons of debugging info given on error to help pinpoint problem.

5. Native Encoding
Now, encoding for URL is embedded natively and not plugged in. However, we currently only support KNEN.
(You can implement your own obfuscation method!)

6. Speedup
Lots of redundant code removed. Proxy modualized and functions separately. Greatly reduced the size of master file!

7. Supports Shifting Code
You can give a shift value for the encoding to avoid blacklists. Though currently addresses are static.

Enjoy~
